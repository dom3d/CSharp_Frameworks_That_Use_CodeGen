# C# / CSharp Frameworks That Use Code Generation
There is the perception that code gen in C# is an edge case need. I don't think so. The need is high where performance or simplicity of APIs matter. Often found in the context of reactive systems, remote execution, non OOP approaches or AOT requirements.

## Entitas
It's pretty much at the code of the solution.

## ProtoActor-dotnet
Besides using protobuf (which generates code), there is also a custom code generator for the "Gains" layer

## Zeroformatter
Only to help with AOT compilation for iOS etc.
